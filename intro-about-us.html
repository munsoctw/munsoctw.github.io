                <p>Model United Nations (MUN), often abbreviated as MUN, involves participants portraying representatives of various countries in international conferences to simulate the procedures of discussing global issues, engaging in speeches, debates, proposals,
                and voting. These delegates engage in multilateral negotiations during the conference after familiarizing themselves with their respective countries' political, historical, economic, and global affairs positions and interests.
                </p>
                <p>Those who have participated in MUN generally agree that it enhances their understanding of international affairs and trends. Moreover, it significantly improves their abilities in public speaking, debating, empathy, and teamwork. These practical
                    skills, coupled with the highly social nature of MUN, make it stand out among numerous extracurricular activities and become a popular event among international high school and university students.
                </p>
                <p>Participants in MUN come from diverse backgrounds. They are not only from the humanities and social sciences but also from law, business, engineering, and science faculties. They commonly share a passion for international exchange and a willingness
                    to engage in interdisciplinary learning.

                    The Model United Nations Society Taiwan (MST) was established in 2021 as a cross-campus academic organization with the mission of promoting Model United Nations (MUN) and fostering a domestic community network while creating opportunities for Taiwanese
                    students to connect internationally.
                </p>
                <p>The team is composed of outstanding students from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, National Taipei University, National Taiwan University, and other institutions in Taiwan. In 2021, amidst the raging pandemic, MUN clubs in schools
                    were severely impacted. However, Taiwanese students from around the world united and founded MST, aiming to continue providing MUN experiences for Taiwanese youth.
                </p>
                <p>MST is dedicated to enhancing the cohesion and synergy of the Taiwanese MUN community through organizing conferences, academic, and social activities. To help more students understand MUN, MST launched free online courses and workshops on
                    MUN during the summer of 2021, attracting hundreds of high school, vocational school, and university students to participate. Besides organizing conferences and delegations, team members are frequently invited by domestic conferences and
                    clubs to serve as keynote speakers and workshop instructors. The members' presence can be seen across Taiwan, almost in every public conference.
                </p>
                <p>To bring Taiwanese students to the international stage, the MUN Society Taiwan aims to connect students from diverse backgrounds, promote friendship, and foster mutual growth. By interconnecting and pooling resources and opportunities, they
                    strengthen the domestic MUN community to break the international stereotypes and discrimination against Taiwan and strive to excel on the international stage. In 2023, the society will focus on guiding more high school students to independently
                    organize conferences and host activities like workshops and social gatherings across Taiwan.

                <h2>Organize a "truly" international student forum, and drive the domestic university Model United Nations (MUN) community to make Taiwanese students proud of Taiwan!</h2>
                <p>In recent years, Taiwan has lacked any international-level student forums, and most student events claiming to be "international" have had less than 50% foreign participants. However, with the strong appeal of the WorldMUN brand, it has brought
                    about an impressive gathering of over 1400 foreign university students attending the conference in Taiwan.</p>

                            most attendees become outstanding figures in their respective fields. Bringing these elites to Taiwan will allow them to establish connections with Taiwanese culture and people, thus enhancing Taiwan's favorability and reputation

                            local cuisine, visit famous landmarks, and explore night markets. The five conference evenings will all be themed around Taiwanese culture, held at cultural landmarks such as Liberty Square and Huashan. During the conference excursions,

                        <p>Holding WorldMUN in Taipei will significantly lower the threshold for Taiwanese students' participation. The team will actively support local university delegations and use the event's appeal to reshape MUN's attractiveness to local
                            university students, revitalizing the MUN community in our country.</p>
                        <p>The success of WorldMUN Taipei in 2010 ignited enthusiasm for MUN among universities and led to the flourishing development of high school MUN clubs.</p>
                        <p>WorldMUN Taipei 2024 will undoubtedly set new heights in the capacity for international affairs education in our country!</p>
